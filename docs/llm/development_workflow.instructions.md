# Development Workflow Instructions

You are working on the SparX Wallet Flutter project. Follow these critical workflow and process rules.

## Git and Branch Management

### Branch Creation and Naming

- **ALWAYS** create branches from `dev`, never from `main`
- **ALWAYS** include YouTrack ticket ID in branch names
- Use format: `{type}/EWM-{number}_{description}`
  - Features: `feature/EWM-511_typesafe_navigation`
  - Bugs: `fix/EWM-507_crash_on_startup`
  - Refactoring: `refactor/EWM-502_separated_column`
  - Releases: `release/EWM-492_1.5.0_update_screen`

### Commit Messages

- **MUST** follow conventional commits format: `<type>[optional scope]: <description>`
- **ALWAYS** include YouTrack ticket ID in scope when the change is tied to a task: `feat(EWM-511): add route navigation`
- Common types in this repo: `feat`, `fix`, `build`, `chore`, `ci`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`
- For breaking changes, use `!` after the type or scope and/or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer instead of using `BREAKING CHANGE` as the commit type
- **NEVER** add co-authored blocks or Claude Code attribution in commit messages
- Keep commit messages concise - for small changes, use short descriptive messages

### Merge Strategies

- **Regular task branches** (feature/, fix/, refactor/): Use "Squash and merge" into `dev`
- **Release branches**: Use regular "Merge" (not squash) into `main` to preserve commit history

## YouTrack Task Management

### Task Status Workflow

Follow this exact sequence:

1. **To Do** → **In Progress** (when starting work)
2. **In Progress** → **Review** (when creating PR)
3. **Review** → **Ready to Test** (after code review approval)
4. **Ready to Test** → **Testing** (QA starts testing)
5. **Testing** → **Verified** (QA completes testing)
6. **Verified** → **Released** (deployed to production)

### Task Development Process

1. Take YouTrack ticket, move to "In Progress", assign to yourself
2. Create branch from `dev` with proper naming
3. Implement changes with focused commits
4. Run `melos run check-all` before creating PR
5. Create PR with YouTrack ID in title and detailed description
6. Move task to "Review" status
7. Address review feedback, keep in "Review" until approved
8. Provide detailed testing instructions for QA
9. QA will handle testing and merge process

## Pull Request Requirements

### PR Title and Description

- Include YouTrack ticket ID in title
- Use the comprehensive PR template with all sections:
  - Description with bullet points focusing on USER VALUE (what benefit users get)
  - Solution with implementation details
  - Type of change checklist
  - Testing instructions
  - QA testing results section
- **NEVER** add co-authored blocks or Claude Code attribution in PR descriptions
- In description section, focus only on the value and benefit to users, not technical implementation details

## Testing Instructions for QA

When providing testing instructions, include:

- Step-by-step process to test functionality
- Test environment setup requirements
- Expected outcomes and success criteria
- Edge cases to verify
- Required test accounts or credentials
- For multi-branch tasks: information about all nested branches and PRs

## Critical Rules

- **NEVER** commit directly to `main` or `dev`
- **ALWAYS** update YouTrack status as work progresses
- **ALWAYS** ensure tests pass before creating PRs
- **ALWAYS** delete branches after merging
- **ALWAYS** sync regularly with `dev` to minimize conflicts
- **ALWAYS** provide comprehensive testing instructions

## Error Handling

If CI checks fail:

- Fix issues and push new commits
- Do not create new PRs - update existing ones
- GitHub Actions will automatically re-run checks
